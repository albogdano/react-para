[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/Erudika/para](https://badges.gitter.im/Erudika/para.svg)](https://gitter.im/Erudika/para?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

This is an example application for managing recipes, built with React and Para.
It is part of a tutorial on [how to get started quickly with React](https://www.erudika.com/blog/2019/08/14/Building-a-full-stack-application-from-scratch-with-React/) 
and how to integrate your React frontend with a Para backend.
It's a simple recipe manager app with:

- CRUD functionality for recipes
- Full-text search
- Markdown support

## [Live DEMO](https://albogdano.github.io/react-para/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vite.dev).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
